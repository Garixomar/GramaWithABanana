MAKE SURE TO HAVE UNITY3D VERSION 2020.1.8F1! OTHERWISE THE UNITY PACKAGE WILL BREAK OR THINGS WON'T LOOK TOO HOT WITHIN THE PROJECT!

This will be updated weekly with code changes, artistic remakes, and changing in mechanics.

- If there's any code missing or if there have been errors in the console log, either go to the branch/game and the code missing should be there or if any other problem appears then notify me at Garixomar911@gmail.com
